# 🏠 UnicoreHome — A Smart Home Capstone Project with Spring + React + Arduino

UnicoreHome is a full-featured web and hardware application for managing smart home environments. Developed as a capstone project, it includes a backend built with Java Spring Framework, a frontend developed in React, and hardware devices based on ESP8266 programmed in C++ using Arduino. The system allows users to manage digital environments, connect smart devices, collaborate with other users, and interact with a support service.

## 🌐 Architecture

- 🖥️ Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, Liquibase, PostgreSQL
- 📬 Email: FreeMarker for templated emails (verification, notifications)
- 💻 Frontend: React (developed by another contributor)
- 📡 Hardware: ESP8266 + Arduino C++
- 🔁 Communication: Short polling (to bypass NAT and CORS preflight restrictions)
- 🐳 Docker: Containerization of backend and database
